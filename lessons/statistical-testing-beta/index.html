                            <p>This lesson can be used as an introduction to Analytical Chemistry Statistical Analysis tasks in Python.
The suggested context would be to walk through it together during the third week of Analytical Laboratory.
About two hours should be allocated to this lesson, in the context of a three-hour period in which the first hour is spent counting pennies.</p>

Instructors may wish to tailor the lesson to highlight specific content learning objectives for statistical analysis.</p>

                        <div>This introductory module should work well as a third programming lesson for students with no prior coding experience.</p><p>Teaching tips:<br>• Students are learning for the first time here how to import data from CSV files.  <br>• Several types of data and coding structures are introduced here for the first time, so introductory text may be worthwhile for students to read.<br>• Using an Excel template to organize data into properly formatted CSV files with matching column headers is critical.<br>• (Not included) In Task 2, the Python code here does NOT automatically generate tables of data organized by year for students<br>  to print out and tape into their lab notebooks.  If you feel this is useful, the two print statements can be modified to do so.<br>• In Task 5, students are asked to copy/paste/modify code for a graph of brass penny data to make a graph for zinc penny data.<br>  If time is tight, you may wish to provide students with hints and/or the sample-code for the zinc penny graph.<br>• Students should work together in groups to ensure they are accountable to understand each part.<br>• Encourage students to share ideas but code/answer questions in their own copy of the notebook.<br>• Remind students to save their own copy before they begin work.<br>• Some students may have several Google accounts; remind them to be aware of which account is logged in when they save.<br>• Keeping an eye on the time may be helpful to ensure students are progressing at a reasonable pace.</p><p>Timing notes:<br>• Although this has not yet been piloted, it was based on a corresponding activity using Excel that typically took 2 hours.<br>• Task 1 is anticipated to take students 20-25 minutes (including the work of creating/uploading properly formatted CSV files)<br>• Task 2 is anticipated to take students 10-15 minutes.  <br>• Task 3 is *anticipated* to take students 10-20 minutes. If outliers are found and decisions are made to clean data, it may take up to 25 minutes.<br>• Task 4 is *anticipated* to take students 15-20 minutes if they already know how a Student's T test works.<br>  It may be helpful to stop here and add in a 5-minute mini-lecture about Student's T tests, null hypothesis, etc. so everyone is on the same page.<br>• Task 5 is anticipated to take students 10-15 minutes.  If time is tight, you may wish to provide hints and/or sample-code to assist, or else skip the second graph.<br>  Also, please remind students of how to save and print the graphs to tape into their lab notebook.<br>• Task 6 is *anticipated* to take students 15-20 minutes if they do the code commenting and as instructed.  <br>  If time is tight, you may wish to advise students to run the code without comments, and work together on answering questions.<br>  Also, please remind students to save and print the graphs to tape into their lab notebook.</p><p>Common student questions:<br>• Students may ask if they need to tape the graph into their laboratory notebook before turning it in.<br>• Students may ask if the output from Part 2 is sufficient for the data tables that they should print out.<br>  If you want the output to include all grouped data, you will need to modify the two print statements in Part 2 accordingly.<br></div>
