expanded_description: |
  In two guided-inquiry Jupyter notebook activities, students import experimental isobaric heat capacity data, fit the data to a polynomial, and calculate the third law entropies for several substances. The introductory notebook focuses on calculating the entropy of a substance in the solid phase using the Debye extrapolation. The second notebook introduces entropy calculations with phase changes.

  The activities were designed using a guided-inquiry framework and targeted for undergraduate physical chemistry course. Students have a basic understanding of using Jupyter notebooks and importing well-formed CSV files for plotting with matplotlib. Parts of the activities are worked individually, but there are frequent prompts to reflect upon or compare results with group members.

  These activities have been used in a Physical Chemistry I course with 5-15
  students in a 3-hr laboratory period, 2-3 students per group. Students have
  had basic instruction on python/Jupyter and are comfortable using
  spreadsheets, but have had no formal instruction on programming. Students
  have been introduced to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd laws of thermodynamics through
  POGIL exercises. They were familiar with mathematical relationships, but had
  not applied them to real systems.

  Timing notes: Each activity takes 2-3 hrs to complete. However, the notebooks
  have natural break points to accommodate time constraints.
