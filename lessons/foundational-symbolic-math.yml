# BASIC METADATA (REQUIRED)
# Use a clear, descriptive title that includes the main topic
title: "Foundations of Symbolic Mathematics in Python"

# Brief description for search results (1-2 sentences)
description: "Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of symbolic mathematical manipulations in Python."

# Longer description for the lesson page (use | for multi-line text)

  #Provide a more detailed description of your lesson here.
  #Explain the context, what students will accomplish, and how this
  #fits into broader molecular science education.
  #
  #You can use multiple paragraphs to fully describe the lesson scope
  #and learning experience.
  The lessons in this module are meant to help students develop foundational
  skills in symbolic mathematics, including algebra, calculus, linear algebra,
  differential equations, and beyond --- but decoupled from any particular chemistry
  course or chemical application beyond the general chemistry level.

# COURSE INFORMATION (REQUIRED)
# Choose ONE: "None", "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"
programming_skill: "Beginner"
# None: No programming experience. 
# Beginner: Knows variables, conditionals, loops
# Intermediate: Can write their own scripts from scratch
# Advanced: Can write/develop software.

# Examples: "Foundational Module", "Physical Chemistry", "Organic Chemistry", 
# "Inorganic Chemistry", "Analytical Chemistry", "Biochemistry", "Materials Science", "Other"
primary_course: "Foundational Module"

# List other courses where this lesson could be used (optional)
also_for:
  - "General Chemistry"
  - "Physical Chemistry"
  - "Biophysical Chemistry"
  - "Materials Science"
  - "Analytical Chemistry"

# List all authors
authors: 
  - "Prof. Dom Sirianni"

# Estimated total time for all materials
estimated_time: "3 hours" # Currently only for the symbolic-algebra lesson, will grow w/ more

# Write a description of your module.
# Single notebook, multi-part module, etc?
format: "Multi-Part Module" # Currently only one lesson, but will grow with more additions

# INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)
# Contact email for instructor access requests (optional - will use default if not specified)
instructor_email: "sirianni.dom@gmail.com" # will update after I get a Westminster email
# Note: Instructor materials will be located at: instructor-repo/{lesson-filename}/
# where {lesson-filename} matches this YAML file's name

# INSTRUCTOR DETAILS (OPTIONAL)
# What level of students was this piloted with?
student_level: "Undergraduate (all years)"  # e.g., "Graduate", "Undergraduate - First Year", "Mixed Graduate/Undergraduate"
# How many students has this been tested with?

  Additional context for instructors using this lesson:
  - Prerequisite of basic Python programming (equivalent to outcome of related module)
  - Symbolic algebra lesson is prerequisite for other lessons
  
  Timing notes:
  - Symbolic algebra lesson can be completed in single 3-hour lab period
  
  Common student questions:
  - "I can solve these problems by hand, why do I need to use Python?" - Remind students that some chemical problems in sophomore-level courses & beyond are either impossible or backbreakingly difficult to solve by hand, so developing these skills will greatly help their progress through the curriculum
