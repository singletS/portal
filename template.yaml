  Additional context for instructors using this lesson:
  
  - This lesson works well when paired with a traditional lecture on molecular dynamics
  - Students often struggle with the concept of periodic boundary conditions in Part 2
  - The visualization exercises are very engaging - allow extra time for exploration
  - Consider assigning the dataset analysis as homework rather than in-class work
  
  Timing notes:
  - Part 1 typically takes students 45-60 minutes
  - Part 2 can be rushed in 90 minutes but is better with 2 hours
  
  Common student questions:
  - "Why do we need so many time steps?" - good opportunity to discuss numerical integration
  - "What happens if we change the temperature?" - this connects well to thermodynamics concepts
