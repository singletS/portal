  This module is a pair of notebooks designed to teach students how to batch process a set of experimental datafiles, rather than working with each file individually. Students are first taken through fitting one file with an eye towards automation. In the second notebook, two automation options are described. The first, 'soft' automation, simply gives an organization to fitting a moderate number of files by hand. The second teaches students to use glob to find all files of a given type and then use a for loop to fit all files.

  The provided datafiles show the chemiluminescence of bleach when reacted with luminol and peroxide. These files show a sharp rise from the initial reaction, then an exponential decay that has different rates depending on the concentration of the reactants. These notebooks are easily adapted to any set of experimental data showing an exponential decay, common in many kinetics experiments.

  Additional context for instructors using this lesson:

  - These notebooks are intended to support students in analyzing their experimental data
  - The piloted assessment was a separate lab report, so there is no formal assessment within this module
  - Students typically don't complete every step in order. Instead they work at what they need help with.
  - Students often struggle with how close initial parameter guesses need to be
  
  Timing notes:
  - Part 1 typically takes students 30 - 45 minutes
  - Part 2 takes between 1 and 2 hours
